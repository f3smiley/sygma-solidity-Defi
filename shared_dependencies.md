Shared Dependencies:

1. Solidity Contracts: "CrossChainTransfer.sol", "DWETH.sol", "ETHBurn.sol" - These contracts share common Solidity libraries and dependencies such as OpenZeppelin and SafeMath. They also share common function names like "mint", "burn", and "transfer".

2. Migration Script: "2_deploy_contracts.js" - This script shares the contract names "CrossChainTransfer", "DWETH", "ETHBurn" for deployment.

3. Scripts: "cross_chain_transfer.js", "setup_event_listeners.js" - These scripts share the contract instances of "CrossChainTransfer", "DWETH", "ETHBurn", and common event names like "Transfer", "Burn", "Mint".

4. Test Files: "CrossChainTransfer.test.js", "DWETH.test.js", "ETHBurn.test.js" - These test files share common testing libraries like Mocha and Chai, and also share the contract instances of "CrossChainTransfer", "DWETH", "ETHBurn".

6. README: "README.md" - This file shares the project setup instructions, contract details, and other necessary information.

7. Environment Variables: ".env" - This file shares sensitive information like private keys, API keys, RPC URLs, etc.

8. DApp Files: "App.js", "BurnSide.js", "MintSide.js", "WalletConnector.js" - These files share common React libraries, component names, and state variables. They also share DOM element IDs like "connectWallet", "burnAddress", "mintAddress".

9. Asset Files: "fire.svg", "ice.svg" - These files share the common theme of the DApp.

10. Public Index File: "index.html" - This file shares the root DOM element ID where the React App is injected.
