Shared Dependencies:

1. Node.js and npm: These are required to install the Sygma SDK and are used across all the files.

2. Sygma SDK: This is imported in the "configure_sdk_instances.js" file and used across all the files.

3. Sygma Instances: The instances `sygma138` and `sygma1` are created in the "configure_sdk_instances.js" file and used in "setup_event_listeners.js", "perform_cross_chain_transfer.js", "verify_transfer.js", and "complete_transfer.js" files.

4. RPC URLs: The URLs 'https://rpc.public-0138.defi-oracle.io' and 'https://eth.llamarpc.com' are used to create the Sygma instances and are shared across the files.

5. Solidity Contracts: The contracts are compiled and deployed in the "deploy_sygma_solidity_contracts.sh" file and used in the "perform_cross_chain_transfer.js" file.

6. Event Names: The 'Burn' and 'Mint' event names are used in the "setup_event_listeners.js", "perform_cross_chain_transfer.js", and "complete_transfer.js" files.

7. Function Names: The 'burn', 'mint', and 'balanceOf' function names are used in the "perform_cross_chain_transfer.js" and "verify_transfer.js" files.

8. Variables: The variables 'amount', 'recipient', 'sender', and 'bridgeOperator' are used in the "perform_cross_chain_transfer.js" and "verify_transfer.js" files.

9. Gas Limit: The gas limit of 1000000 is used in the "perform_cross_chain_transfer.js" file.

10. Network Names: The network names 'chain138' and 'chain1' are used in the "deploy_sygma_solidity_contracts.sh" file and potentially in other files if they interact with these networks.
